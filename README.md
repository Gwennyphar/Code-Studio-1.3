Code Studio creates its own menu function and the
associated menu items according to the guidelines of the Coding Conventions.
The created menus are always structured in the same way
and clear code. This regularity in programming
enables fast editing and maintenance of the source code.
Code Studio brings significant benefits:
Automation reduces the development time required
clear. The programmer saves the error-prone
Programming work of the single recurring standard functions.
Due to the flexibility of the code generator, this can be on
different operating systems, as well as in the software industry
as well as for educational purposes.
